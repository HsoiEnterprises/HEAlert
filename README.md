# HEAlert
A convenience around `UIAlertController`, because sometimes you just want to say "OK".


# Background and Approach

`UIAlertController` is awesome, but sometimes it's too much. How many times do you simply alert with a message and an "OK" button? Easy with `UIAlertView`, but cumbersome with `UIAlertController`.

That's why I created `HEAlert`.

# Supported OS and SDK

Developed with

- Xcode 6.4 beta 2 (should work with Xcode 6.3.1)
- Swift 1.2
- iOS 8 (minimum, required)


# Installation

Until Cocoapods integration occurs, obtain the code as a git submodule. Add `HEAlert.swift` to your project and off you go.


# Usage

To be added, but hopefully the source code is readable and simple enough.
